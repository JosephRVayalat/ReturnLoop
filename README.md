RETURNLOOP


PROBLEM STATEMENT
High taxi fares burden students and daily commuters, while manual fare-splitting in carpooling causes disputes and non-payments. The increasing number of single-passenger rides also worsens urban traffic congestion and environmental pollution.

SOLUTION
ReturnLoop is designed to make shared rides seamless
and cost-effective. Unlike traditional ride-sharing apps,
we automate fare splittingâ€”ensuring that each
passenger pays their fair share without awkward
conversations.
